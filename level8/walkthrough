1)	first impressions :
		-executable outputs (nil), (nil) when executed
		-never exits, infinite loop
		-only main function

malloc <+140> == 0x804a9c0

auth string points to malloc address


0x8049aac => if login first, is empty
<+387> ; loads address at [eax + 20] == 0xffffce40

when auth : 0x8049aac points to malloced address by auth bloc ("\n")

service *2 allows 0x8049aac + 0x20 (heap location) to point on value " \n"

starting with service does not work bcs 0x8049aac is 0x0 and do not point to the heap.

// ANSWER :
// 1)auth does a malloc, saves the return of malloc (heap address) inside auth buffer in data section
// 2)service does a strdup (new malloc, and copies " \n") inside
// 3)login checks if value at address ds:auth + 0x20 (32) is not null
// 4)reset frees memory pointed by auth buffer
