1)	first impressions :
		-same as before, format string exploit
		-in previous levels, overwriting a given address with a given value would lead to a win.
			=> This time, we only see a o function, called nowhere, that makes us win.
			=> Somehow we need to write an format string exploit that will call this function.
		-There's a call to exit so we cannot just override sEIP.
			=> Looking to override exit, we saw function name was @plt and then @got.plt.
				=> Some reasearches on this quickly led us to know we could change addresses of the global offset table.

2)	Goal : change exit GOT address with o function address.


Address GOT	=	0x8049838
Address o	=	0x080484a4

Change GOT exit address table reference value by o address
