1)	first impressions
		-main
		-greetuser
		-strncpy, strcat, getenv, memcmp, puts

2)	executable does nothing special on use
		=> set env variable ?

Program needs 2 arguments.
says Hello argv[1]
dunno what argv2 is used for.

buf1 == 40 characters
buf2 == 32 characters
putting all 40 as 'A' and all 32 as 'B' creates a segfault.

EBP main = 0xffffcdc8
sEIP main = 0xffffcdcc

EBP greetuser = 0xffffcdc8
sEIP greetuser = 0xffffcd0c

strcat writes greeting string + 72 characters from esp + 16.
with "Hello " as greeting string that leads us to partially overwriting sEIP of greetuser (2 bytes we control, 1 \0, and last byte remains unchanged

with finnish greetings "Hyvää päivää ", we should totally take control over sEIP

Worked in gdb outside vm


Inside VM :

env - gdb bonus2
unset env LINES
unset env COLUMNS
set env LANG=fi
with argv1 40 chars and argv2 22 chars

sEIP greetuser == 0xbffffd2c
start buf == 0xbffffcf2

outside of GDB :

export LANG=fi
env - PWD=$PWD LANG=$LANG /home/user/bonus2 $(/tmp/b2_argv1.sh) $(/tmp/b2_argv2.sh)
