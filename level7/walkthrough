1)	first impressions
		-segfault with or without args
		-info function gives :
			=> main
			=> m

2)	malloc results
		buf1 : 0x804a1a0 => stores buf2 address in 4th to 8th byte
		buf2 : 0x804a1b0 => strcpy<+127> => stores ARGV1 value
		buf3 : 0x804a1c0 => stores buf4 address in 4th to 8th byte
		buf4 : 0x804a1d0 => strcpy<+156> => stores ARGV2 value

3)	[ebp+0xc] == ARGV0
		=> [ebp+0xf] == ARGV1


4)	
	-Goal here is to overwrite Global Offset Table address of puts with m function address.
	-In main function, fgets write contents of .pass file into a buffer (data section or heap ?)
	-If we success to call m function, it prints the content of this buffer.
	

	=> First strcpy replaces value stored inside (buf1 + 4) heap3[4] (heap4 addr) by addr GOT puts (thanks to argv1)
		=> STRCPY1 :
			-DEST : buf1 + 4 == heap2 => overflows to heap3 + 4 (WILL WRITE INTO HEAP3+4)
			-SRC : argv1 (padding to access heap3+4 + addr puts GOT)
	=> Second strcpy stores m address (argv2) into puts GOT addr
		=> STRCPY2 :
			-DEST : buf2 + 4 (previously heap4) now points to puts GOT
			-SRC : argv2 (addr of m)
