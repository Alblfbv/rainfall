1)	first impressions
		-segfault with or without args
		-info function gives :
			=> main
			=> m

2)	malloc results
		buf1 : 0x804a1a0 => stores buf2 address in 4th to 8th byte
		buf2 : 0x804a1b0 => strcpy<+127> => stores ARGV1 value
		buf3 : 0x804a1c0 => stores buf3 address in 4th to 8th byte
		buf4 : 0x804a1d0 => strcpy<+156> => stores ARGV2 value

3)	[ebp+0xc] == ARGV0
		=> [ebp+0xf] == ARGV1
